# Magma
The future of CALDERA's UI/UX.

## Dependencies
* NodeJS (v16+ recommended)
* Caldera (v4.0.0+)

## Installation
Checkout the magma branch in core Caldera. Caldera needs to be running in the background, so be sure to start it up
beforehand and make sure it's accessible at http://localhost:8888.

If you are going to run Magma without developing on it, all you have to do is run Caldera with an extra flag once. To do so:

In the Caldera directory:
1. Run `python3 server.py --build`.

The `--build` flag automatically installs any dependencies, bundles the Vue frontend into a `dist` directory, and is served by the Caldera server.
You will only have to use the `--build` flag again if you add any plugins.

### Development
To serve up the UI in a development environment (with hot-reloading, etc.), do

In the magma directory:
1. Run `npm install`.

In the Caldera directory:
1. Run `python3 server.py --uidev localhost`.

You can reach the UI in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Code Quality
Currently Linting is done manually by the developer. To do so:

1. Run `npm run lint`.

In order to run linting with it automatically formatting issues:

1. Run `npm run lintfix`.

### Testing
Magma uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as its frontend testing framework. All tests are located at the `src/tests` directory.

1. Run `npm run test-all` to run all tests.

Each vue component is tested for accessibility in their respected file. This is done using a custom Jest matcher, [jest-axe](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe). Jest-axe adheres to
[axe-core rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/rule-descriptions.md). Each one of these rules can be modified or disabled when calling the axe function.

1. Run `npm run test-accessibility` to run only accessibility tests.
